1-L2=Before you go on, here are a few important questions:||Did you let the game search for the latest official patches?||Did you start Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, changed the language to that one you'd like the game to use and created a savegame?|||Also note the following specifics when using Windows VISTA/7:|An activated "User Account Control (UAC)" can disable the installation.||To switch it off, do this:||Start -> Control Panel (classic view)|-> User Accounts|-> Turn User Account Control on or off|-> Few clicks|-> Restart the computer, and it's done.||After you are done with the installation and have tested if the game is playable, you may enable the UAC again.|||If you did install the games using the default "Program Files" folder, this may also be a cause of trouble.|Installing or copying BG2EE to a new folder isn't a problem. (like "EET\BG2EE")||If you did consider everything, you are set to start.||If not, you should proceed these steps correctly, before you continue.

[Description]
Mod-EN=The mod introduces two new unique characters. The goblin Bion to the south of the tent in Waukeens promenade teleports you to the merchant Taluntain. The Boards o' Magick (BoM) item pack is for and by SP users (and, of course, for the entire BG2 community!). The original idea behind this pack was to give the BoM regulars the honor they're due by immortalizing them in this great game, but also to offer a selection of somewhat overlooked items the chance to truly shine.

[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod adds a series of dialogues, in which you can discover more about the valiant halfling. Mazzy is not the most talkative woman in the world, but she definitely has her opinions, and will voice them if she feels it appropriate - similarly if she has questions she will not be afraid to ask.

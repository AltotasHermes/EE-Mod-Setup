[Description]
Mod-EN=ATTENTION - The mod causes graphical issues on games as of EE v2.5. The issues initially adressed by the mod have been corrected in the vanilla game by now.
This mod complements the extended night areas that are missing from all main areas except Baldur's Gate and adds the missing night minimaps to all main areas.

[Description]
Mod-EN=Animus is a sentient weapon capable of conversing telepathically with you and you alone. Unlike Lilarcor, Animus is reasonably intelligent and capable of holding an actual conversation-although since it's a telepathic weapon he's incapable of speaking in-battle like Lilarcor. It's normally a +1 weapon with no special benefits, but once you discover a little more about your heritage, it can be upgraded to a +2 longsword with a couple of extra benefits at the cost of it's ability to converse. Animus can be found in the Nashkel general store for a reasonable fee.

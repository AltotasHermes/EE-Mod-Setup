[Description]
Mod-EN=Tome and Blood is a mod that revises and expands the class options for Mages and Sorcerers. This mod began as the Sorcerous Origins kitpack, which took advantage of the newly added Sorcerer kit options to add several kits to Sorcerers. It has since grown into a mod that makes changes to all Mage and Sorcerer kits, spells and items as well as adding dozens of new kits, abilities and functionality.

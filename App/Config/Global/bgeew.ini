[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod is an weapon pack. There is a dwarf, Maltz, located outside of the Friendly Arm Inn, who will sell you these weapons. Some of the weapons are color variations of what you find in the game, some from BG2 and some of them are new. The magical weapons are expensive so you will have to save a lot of gold to buy them.

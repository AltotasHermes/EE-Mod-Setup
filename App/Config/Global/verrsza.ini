[Description]
Mod-EN=The mod introduces a new companion for BG1 - Verr'Sza, an evil rakshasa hunter. ||The mod includes some go-and-kill quests, as well as a romance for both male and female characters (the only condition is not being of Lawful Good alignment). Although it's technically a romance, Verr'Sza isn't a very romantic character.

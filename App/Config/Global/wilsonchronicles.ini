@0=Wilson Chronicles - expansion for our favorite bear companion
Tra=0

[Description]
Mod-EN=The mod includes party dialogues and some encounters to make sure those groups who travel with the bear companion won't suffer from a lack of interesting events. The added dialogue maintains the style of the original game: bears have their own language.

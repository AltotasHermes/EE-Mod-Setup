[Description]
Mod-EN=With tensions rising between Baldur's Gate and Amn, and rumors of unnatural disasters plaguing Amnish territory on the Sword Coast, a young Cowled Wizard has taken it upon herself to learn the truth of the matter. Adventurers willing to work with a Cowled Wizard will find a willing ally in their Nashkel investigations and beyond. This mod includes a friendship with flirtation opportunities, banters, interjections and comments on the world of Baldur's Gate.

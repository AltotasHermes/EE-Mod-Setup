[Description]
Mod-EN=This is a WeiDu mod for BG:Enhanced edition and BG2:Enhanced edition that changes 2ed ADnD rules to DnD 3.5 with some elements taken from Pathfinder. It changes game mechanics (i.e. classes, spells, abilities, etc...) to that of 3.5 edition (to the extent that game engine allows).

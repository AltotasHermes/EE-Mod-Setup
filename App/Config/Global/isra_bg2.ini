[Description]
Mod-EN=Isra is a twenty-one year old paladin with the Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose, an order devoted to Sune Firehair. She has far more experience with (and sympathy for) the chaotic good churches of Sune and Lliira than any of the lawful churches, so her outlook and personality are somewhat removed from what you might expect from a paladin.|  |Isra can be found in the Den of the Seven Vales in Waukeen's Promenade, where she is looking into some family concerns. She will not immediately join the party, though you will have the chance to establish whether or not you knew her in BG1. There will be significant differences in her early dialogue depending upon which you choose.

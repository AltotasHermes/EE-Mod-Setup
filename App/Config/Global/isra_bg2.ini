[Description]
Mod-EN=Isra is a twenty-one year old paladin with the Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose, an order devoted to Sune Firehair. She has far more experience with (and sympathy for) the chaotic good churches of Sune and Lliira than any of the lawful churches, so her outlook and personality are somewhat removed from what you might expect from a paladin.

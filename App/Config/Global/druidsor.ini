[Description]
Mod-EN=Geomancy is the art of channeling magical energy from many sources of the earth. This kit is strongly based on the Druidic Sorcerer Kit. The kit combines the sorcerer's spellcasting methods and spells with additional druidic spells and abilities and features its own unique tiered HLA progression and custom spells. If the requirements are fulfilled the abilities are attainable through a very special item given by a genie at the start of Chateau Irenicus.

[Description]
Mod-EN=This story involves an affiliation between Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate 2. In Athkatla you meet the sorcerer Nomoran (in ToB in Saradush, if the mod had not been played in SoA) and asks you for assistance in the fight against a horde of monsters. By his magic you get directly to the mountains near the village "Anegh". Depending on whether you play the mod in SoA or in ToB you will get two different ends.

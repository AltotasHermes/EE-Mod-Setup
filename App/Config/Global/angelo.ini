[Description]
Mod-EN=Angelo Dosan is the fighter-turned-mage who served as your brother's henchman in Baldur's Gate. Most likely he didn't survive your game, but people in this world seem to have a knack for not staying dead. In the Angelo NPC Mod, Angelo tracks you down in the Graveyard District to make you an offer you can't refuse (though perhaps you will).

[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod complements the extended night areas that are missing from all main areas except Baldur's Gate and adds the missing night minimaps to all main areas. This mod is currently Expert because users have reported crashes on day/night transition due to missing or corrupted WED/TIS files (e.g., AR3000N.WED).

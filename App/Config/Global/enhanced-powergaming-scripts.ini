[Description]
Mod-EN=A collection of player AI scripts to allow players to focus on the fighting aspect of combat while these take care of the nuances in the background. These scripts allow easy pre-buffing of all characters with a keystroke, intelligent debuffing of enemy protections, and smart use of defensive spells and abilities.

[Description]
Mod-EN=Isra is a follower of Sune Firehair, the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, and the only chaotic aligned deity to sponsor paladins. As such, she isn't necessarily what you might expect of a paladin. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though). You can find her in the Nashkel Mines region, trying (with no success whatsoever) to resolve Prism's legal difficulties.

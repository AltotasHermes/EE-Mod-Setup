[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod allows divine casters to select a deity and have that selection translate into meaningful new abilities and disabilities.  Kits are revised, new kits are added and spell access is determined by a system of major and minor spheres (supplemented with spells from Icewind Dale). NOTE - you can do a manual fine selection by changing d5_fnp_settings.ini file in the mod folder before installation.

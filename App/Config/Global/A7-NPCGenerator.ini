[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod allows you to install any number of pregenerated or exported characters as regular NPCs. They can be met at predetermined locations where you have the chance to invite them into your party or have them tag along without occupying party slots at any time in the game. ATTENTION - the automated installation is not recommended since it does not offer all dynamic optionss the mod allows for your game. It is FAR BETTER to manually install the mod once Install Tool has finished the main installation.

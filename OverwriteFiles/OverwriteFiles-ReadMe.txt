Sometimes you need to overwrite mod files AFTER extraction but BEFORE "Fixpack" fixes processing
In such case you can put any custom mod files using exactly the same folder structure, inside correct game top folder to avoid pausing installation and manual copying.

OverwriteFiles\BG1EE - it's for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition
OverwriteFiles\BG2EE - Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition and Enhanced Edition Trilogy
OverwriteFiles\IWD1EE - it's for Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition
OverwriteFiles\PSTEE - it's for Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition

Example of usage:

Mod Scales of Balance has custom ini file for settings: scales_of_balance\sob_settings.ini
Put you customized "sob_settings.ini" file inside "BG1EE\scales_of_balance" or "BG2EE\scales_of_balance" folder and it will be used during installation.

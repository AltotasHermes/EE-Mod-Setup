### Getting started ###

1. Download Big World Setup zip archive and extract it anywhere you want (but not in your game folder!)
2. Close any open games and game editors to avoid interference with the installation process
3. Disable your antivirus (only while you are installing - don't forget to re-enable it after!)
4. Disable User Account Control (if you don't do this, the automated installation can get stuck!)
5. Execute "Update BWS-EE Setup.vbs" when this is the first time you launch it for this game. If you need to re-start during a setup, use "Start BWS-EE Setup.vbs" instead.
Note: If you reuse the tool and you kept the previously downloaded mods stored, you can use "Update BWS-EE Setup.vbs" to renew instead of having to download the tool and valid mods once again. 
6. Select game to be modded.
7. Enter the game path(s) of the base game(s) you want to mod
8. Go to the mod selection and either import a pre-selection from the *compilations* folder OR make your own free choice of the mods you want (you can also take a compilation as a starting point and adjust it to your liking)
9. Use the *Back* button to leave mod selection - at this point you may be shown conflicts or problems you have in your selection and you can resolve those with the help provided in the menus
10. When you have established a mod selection you are happy with *continue* and follow the instructions.

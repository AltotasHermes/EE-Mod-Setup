Since there is no active BWS code maintainer, there is no point reporting issues because there is no one who can fix them.

### Supported mods ###

- Almost all of them! (use the Mod Request Template link above if there is a mod you want added)

### Getting started ###

0. Download Big World Setup zip archive and extract it anywhere you want (but not in your game folder!)
1. Close any open games and game editors to avoid interference with the installation process
2. Disable your antivirus (only while you are installing - don't forget to re-enable it after!)
3. Disable User Account Control (if you don't do this, the automated installation can get stuck!)
4. Execute "Start BiG World Setup - Update If Needed.vbs" (this is the usual way to start the program)
5. Optional: "Start BiG World Setup-Full - Without Update.vbs" (this will skip the auto-update feature)

NOTE:  "Update If Needed" will download any updates to the program and revert any local changes you have made.  
If you are in the middle of an installation, it is safest to use "Without Update", but at all other times you should use "Update If Needed".  

### How do I contribute? ###

* learn git basics (https://git-scm.com/videos https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
* fork BWS repository using "SourceTree" or "SmartGit" or other preferred tool
* add mods/make other changes (see FAQ in the Docs folder of the BWS package!)
* create a pull request to submit changes from your fork back to the main project

[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod is a romance expansion for Dorn, and NPC character added into BG2:EE by Beamdog. This increases Dorn's total content to about 26 talks in SOA and 6 talks in TOB, plus some interjections for TOB. The expansion adds new talks, expands and modifies existing ones and sometimes changes their order. Starting a new game is STRONGLY recommended, as the romance might not make sense otherwise. The expansion is written for Dorn FREE OF PATRON. Seriously, it will not make sense otherwise. Consider it like this- if Dorn has a patron, he is effectively slave/bound to someone else. He has no reason to open up to CHARNAME or make any concrete plans for the future, perhaps he might have ulterior motive for romancing you. Thus, the original romance (no bodhi abduction, old epilogues etc.) makes sense and this mod should not be installed. Somewhere in the romance (SOA), there is an alignment shift on chaotic/lawful scale. Dorn stays evil!

Some of these mods include unbalanced items and will make the game less challenging.||Tactical - Like the Maximized selection but with additional mods and component choices that make the game more challenging. This version is only for experienced players.||Expert - Also installs mods which have known problems or incompatibilities. This is for debugging by expert users only and is not intended for play. If you choose this version, you should know how IE programming and how to troubleshoot problems by yourself.|||If you want to customize the selection, be sure to click the button below.

(like "BiG World\PSTEE")|||If you already use Windows 8, it is reported that you'll have trouble if you don't run the BWS with administrator-rights. To do that, open the context-menu of BiG World Setup\Autoit3.exe, select the "run as administrator"-entry and select the BiG World Setup.au3 from the file dialogue. This may also solve issues if you are using Windows 7.|||If you did consider everything, you are set to start.||If not, you should proceed these steps correctly, before you continue.

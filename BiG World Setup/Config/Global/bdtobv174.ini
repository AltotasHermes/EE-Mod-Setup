Improved Monk Class changes:
- Immunity to hold
- Immunity to level drain
- Monks are allowed to wear light armor
- Monks gain +1 to hit and +1 to damage for every 4 levels.
- Monks apply 10% cumulative spell failure penalty with each successful hit on a spellcaster.
- Monks achieve their fist damage range (1-20) at level 15 instead of level 17
- Armor class bonuses slow down after level 21 (1 every 3 levels until 30, 1 every 5 levels until 40). Monks gain a special one-time bonus of -2 armour class for every 5 levels.
- Monks have the Read Scrolls ability for cleric scrolls. A monk may equip a cleric scroll in a Quick Item slot and use it, casting the spell and consuming the scroll in the process.
- Monks gain magic resistance at +1% for every 2 levels (monks originally received 3% per level), +42% at level 14 (a special one-time bonus) and +3% per level until 100%

-  7th  level:  Lay on Hands to heal 2 hit points per level

-  13th level:  Quivering palm spell once per day. This spell gives them one hand attack. If they hit an opponent, the opponent must save or die. NOTE: This special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.

[Description]
Mod-EN=Rjali NPC MOD is a romance add-on for the game Baldur's Gate II Extended Edition, with the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack.||Rjali is an amorous cleric/thief who will not leave your side. You just cannot get rid of her. She will accept your other amours as long as you take good care of her. Primary interests: romance and the search for the perfect taco. She is strictly a one man woman, and you are that man. She refuses to have anything to do with female and/or evil PCs.||This mod is intended only for heterosexual, non-evil males. My apologies to all those other gamers who are otherwise amorously inclined. I am an old guy with limited tastes. This is not intended as a slight, but as an expression of my own daydreams. As for yours, roll your own with my blessing. So to speak...

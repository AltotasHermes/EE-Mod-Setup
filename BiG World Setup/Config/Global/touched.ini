[Description]
Mod-EN=Touchstone is a fully voiced joinable Elven Fighter from the Great Forest. You can find him in the Docks District of Athkatla. He has talks with the main character and the BioWare NPCs and brings his own task. Alternate portraits can be found in the portraits folder of the mod (touched\portraits). Simply rename the portrait you wish to use to BKtouch1, M & S and place them in the override folder. The optional component installs a custom Wild Elf Fighter kit for Touchstone only (the kit is not selectable for the player character). Otherwise Touchstone is a vanilla fighter class.

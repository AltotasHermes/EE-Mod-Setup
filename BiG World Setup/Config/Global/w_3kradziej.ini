[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod allows you to force unconscious creatures to drop all their equipment to the ground. You could say it adds another option for robbery. After installing this mod (you don't have to start a new game), your party members should receive a special ability called "search body" (you must activate party AI for this, but you can deactivate it again later) that will allow you to force unconscious creatures to drop all their equipment to the ground (except for the items marked as critical, which should be transferred to your inventory). If you install the first component there will be a 15% chance that the creature will be awakened; if you don't, there will be a 15% chance that nothing will happen.
Mod-GE=Dieser Mod erlaubt Euch, bewuЯtlosen Kreaturen Ihre Ausrьstung zu entwenden. Ihr habt also eine weitere Option neben dem normalen Diebstahl. After installing this mod (you don't have to start a new game), your party members should receive a special ability called "search body" (you must activate party AI for this, but you can deactivate it again later) that will allow you to force unconscious creatures to drop all their equipment to the ground (except for the items marked as critical, which should be transferred to your inventory). If you install the first component there will be a 15% chance that the creature will be awakened; if you don't, there will be a 15% chance that nothing will happen.
Mod-RU=Заставляет бессознательных существ бросать свое обмундирование на землю. After installing this mod (you don't have to start a new game), your party members should receive a special ability called "search body" (you must activate party AI for this, but you can deactivate it again later) that will allow you to force unconscious creatures to drop all their equipment to the ground (except for the items marked as critical, which should be transferred to your inventory). If you install the first component there will be a 15% chance that the creature will be awakened; if you don't, there will be a 15% chance that nothing will happen.

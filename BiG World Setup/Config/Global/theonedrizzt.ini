[Description]
Mod-EN=This mods adjusts Drizzt from Drizzt Saga and Region of Terror. Now, you can travel with Drizzt from BG1 to BG2 and keep Drizzt's level and inventory.|Warning: This mod overwrites files instead of patching. This mod allows unequipping Drizzt's offhand item, which could cause crashes in BGT/Tutu if anything else is equipped into Drizzt's shield slot. It also changes Drizzt into a level 1 character, while not making any adjustments to levels of his friends or the levels and abilities of the enemies introduced in Drizzt Saga. This shifts Drizzt from strongest to weakest among his friends, and makes completing Drizzt Saga considerably harder than intended. This mod is not usable currently because it both requires and is incompatible with Drizzt Saga (this mod hasn't been updated while that one has been).

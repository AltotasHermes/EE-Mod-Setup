Animus=Animus is a sentient weapon capable of conversing telepathically with you and you alone. Unlike Lilarcor, Animus is reasonably intelligent and capable of holding an actual conversation-although since it's a telepathic weapon he's incapable of speaking in-battle like Lilarcor. It's normally a +1 weapon with no special benefits, but once you discover a little more about your heritage, it can be upgraded to a +2 longsword with a couple of extra benefits at the cost of it's ability to converse. Animus can be found in the Nashkel general store for a reasonable fee.

This will now give an impression of being one big, cohesive area.
bg1aerie=This simple little mod simply adds an appearance from the wingless wonder, Aerie, at the Nashkel Fair in BG1. She's not a joinable NPC (although you can of course do the console thing to add her to your group if you want, but there are no banters written for her). There are a couple of little things you can help her with, and in return she opens a little store at the fair.

Some of the armors are color variations of what you find in the game and some of them are new. The magical armors are expensive so you will have to save a lot of gold to buy them.
BGEEClassicMovies=This is mini-mod that restores the classic movies from the original Baldur’s Gate and selected movies from Baldur’s Gate II to Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition. The classic movies have been resized to the same dimensions as the new BG:EE movies (1280x720) while maintaining their aspect ratios.
bgeegraphics=This mod complements the extended night areas that are missing from all main areas except Baldur's Gate and adds the missing night minimaps to all main areas. It also fixes around ninety percent of the visual stupidities in Baldur's Gate city. These ranged from windows showing at night and not in the day (or vice versa) to whole buildings that changed from nicely maintained habitations during the day to complete derelicts as the sun went down. It gives all of the wall braziers their missing flames. Finally, almost all of the nasty blue and purple patches have been removed from the streets. This mod is currently Expert because users have reported crashes on day/night transition due to missing or corrupted WED/TIS files (e.g., AR3000N.WED).
bgeegraphics_part2=This is one of the needed download-packages for the Graphics Overhaul mod. This mod is currently Expert because users have reported crashes on day/night transition due to missing or corrupted WED/TIS files (e.g., AR3000N.WED).

Divine_Remix=This mod aims to rebalance and change several aspects of divine-magic-using classes (clerics, paladins, druids, and rangers) in Baldur's Gate I + II. As well as arcane magic has its different school, the divine magic is divided into effect spheres like animal, nekromantic, protection etc. The available magic are depending on belief of the user in the different divinities and, hence, are limited to the effect sphere of the divinities and can vary from class to class and even within the character classes.

FinchNPC=Finch Bloomwhiffler, a neutral good gnome cleric of Deneir, is quick to enthuse about stories she has read, libraries she has visited and tomes that she has had the honor to copy, but for all her knowledge, Finch has never truly experienced a life of adventure outside the pages of a book until you encounter her. Banter with Indira and Mur'Neth custom NPCs, if installed.
fullplate=This mod is one big rework of the armour system of BG2 and IWD. Light, enchanted armours actually help you dodge. Heavy, enchanted armours don't help dodging much, but they absorb perhaps half or more of an blow in exchange for slowing you down and fatiguing you. |Stealth, thieving and casting in heavy armour is possible, but difficult.||Warning! This mod needs to be downloaded manually.

The main component is for BG1EE ONLY, though some of the minor components could be installed on BG2EE. ATTENTION THIS MOD MAY CONFLICT WITH Item Revisions and Spell Revisions and SCS.

Isandir=Portrait pack by Isandir in a style similar to vanilla BG1 portraits and few in BG2 style. In Enhanced Edition games you will be able to choose new portraits right from the GUI menu, like the vanilla ones (new references are added into BGEE.sql). In non EE games all portraits will be just copied to Portraits folder, so you will need to choose them from the Custom menu.|The Ust Natha component implements Ust Natha BG2 NPC Portraits during Underdark questline. Normal ones will be swapped with Ust Natha version as soon as Adalon casts her illusion spells. When the illusion is over (when you attack Adalon or when leaving the Underdark) the portraits will be changed back to normal ones. Currently the follwing vanilla NPCs don't have Ust Natha portraits: Yoshimo, Hexxat. If Isandir decides to make them they will be included in future versions of the mod.
isra=Isra is a follower of Sune Firehair, the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, and the only chaotic aligned deity to sponsor paladins. As such, she isn't necessarily what you might expect of a paladin. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though). You can find her in the Nashkel Mines region, trying (with no success whatsoever) to resolve Prism's legal difficulties.
item_rev=CAUTION Not compatible with EE Shamans!!  Item Revisions aims to fix/tweak/enhance all items in Baldur's Gate II. Weaker items have been improved, overpowered ones have been (or will be) nerfed, many descriptions have been extended or replaced with more appropriate ones, and so on. In addition, there are a number of rule changes available that can be chosen individually as the user wishes.||Warning: This is a pre-release version that may not be stable. It is open for playtesting with the understanding that feedback is desired.
iwdification=The mod adds various elements such as selectable bard songs, two-handed axes, and over 65 new spells into the Baldur's Gate series of games. Every component can be installed independently of one another.
jaheirarecast=This mod reconnects Jaheira's SoD voiceover files to the dialog lines and gives Jaheira's soundset an SoD update like the other returning NPCs. ATTENTION requires SoD

kitpack=This is a collection of several kits, adding to the selection of fighters, rangers, paladins, clerics, druids, thieves or bards.
kittomes=In Baldur's Gate 1 originally were no kits. In Baldur's Gate 2, characters start out at a later level and can have a kit.

This mod adds a merchant, Panver the Loremaster, outside of the Friendly Arm Inn who will sell you magical career tomes that can add a kit to a character.
klatu=Assortment of smaller content, rule, and cosmetic changes.
leui=lefreut's enhanced UI provides an unified and improved UI for Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition games.
LightingPack=This mod provides a way to bring back the means to adjust brightness, contrast and gamma correction. You can choose from a set of predefined lighting configurations or enter the desired values manually.
lolfixer=Majestic fixer for almost everything that bothers your game. These are pure fixes that will never remove content that otherwise would be available. Tweak components are optional. This mod's Creature Inventory Overhauler component and Miloch's Creature Fixer mod both solve the same problem (the game crashes when creatures have invalid item combinations equipped, for example a 2H sword with a shield at the same time), but Miloch's Creature Fixer deletes such items while the Overhauler moves such items to inventory so no content is lost. Either solution works, so you may choose which one you prefer.
m7multikit=Ever wanted to play an Anti-Paladin/Necromancer/Assassin? What about a Kensai/Transmuter/Bounty-Hunter? Berserker/Priest of Talos? Or maybe even a Barbarian/Wildmage/Adventurer?||Well, now you can. This mod creates a multikit from the kits you select during installation (or by editing the tp2 file, but that isn't normally recommended). You must then apply the kit with the auto-generated script.||You will be prompted during BWS installation! Read the README!||Warning: This is a pre-release version and might not be stable yet. Please report any problems!
margarita=Margarita is a young halfling that seems to be traveling the Sword Coast, although it is obvious she isn't quite from around there. She's defensive, quiet, and prone to sarcasm when pushed or confronted. She likes to come off as useless, timid, or otherwise innocent, even if that isn't quite the case. Her main belief is: Honor Thy Employer. She does whatever is in her power to complete her employer's tasks, asks no questions except: "How much will I be paid." She is intelligent enough however to see if her life is endangered, and will not endanger it if she can help it (At this case, the price becomes too high).||Warning! This mod needs to be downloaded manually.
Mercenary=A new Fighter Kit who knows how to fight dirty.
might_and_guile=This mod is all about improving gameplay. If tweaking a rule makes this specific game more fun, then it's a good tweak, PnP be damned. Consider this mod as a collection of 'house rules' specific to the BG campaign. Every choice has been made with an eye to the particular gameplay mechanics of BG2 and the EEs.
msfm=This mod aims to make mages in the game to appear more stylish. For that end it adds mage-specific staffs with ranged attacks and circlets, plus it also tweaks all robes, so that player can choose their look.
Mur'Neth=He is a member of the race of ooze-like shapechangers who venerate Ghaunadaur, the evil deity of oozes, moulds and the like.
neera=The Neera Expansion mod adds a series of dialogues to the lovely elven wild mage Neera, in an effort to help flesh out her personality. For the romantically inclined, it also adds a number of flirts that you can initiate if you talk to her.
neerabanters=The Neera Banters mod adds banters between Neera and other joinable NPCs available in BGEE.
npc_ee=This is intended to be a successor to the fantastic "Level 1 NPCs" mod. L1NPCs was never updated for the EE games, and its author is no longer active, and it is an incredible, complicated piece of work that is difficult for someone else to update. So I made this.
NTotSC=NTotSC adds several quests to the BG1 part (with TotSC) to the game. Some are minor encounters with no further impact, but some are larger quests that are also partly connected to each other.
paintbg=PaintBG is a mod that replaces each of the NPC portraits of Baldur's Gate with original artwork by artastrophe. This portrait pack also overwrites the PC portraits included in the original game with new images to choose from! As always, each of these components is available to install separately.
PaleMaster=PALE MASTER: Necromancy is usually a poor choice for arcane spellcasters -- those who really want to master the deathless arts almost always pursue divine means. However, an alternative exists for those who desire power over undead but refuse to give up their arcane craft completely. Enter the pale master, who draws on a font of special lore that provides a macabre power all its own.
PPE=This mod adds portraits to speaking NPCs in the Enhanced Edition Infinity Engine games. Including specific portraits for many and random portraits generic speakers.
RaduzielsUniversalSpells=This mod removes the specialists' restriction from some spells and their scrolls

scales_of_balance=This mod is all about improving gameplay. If tweaking a rule makes this specific game more fun, then it's a good tweak, PnP be damned. Consider this mod as a collection of 'house rules' specific to the BG campaign. Every choice has been made with an eye to the particular gameplay mechanics of BG2 and the EEs. Some components sometimes need expert interventions later in the game.
sentrizeal_aa_pack=Wizard Fix: Several of the archmagi robe avatars are flawed due to missing 2-handed thrust animation the original developers forgot to put. This will fix them for good.||Female Ranger Avatar: You know what we need to see more in this game? Cloaks. We 'visually' need more cloaks. Why limited to mages only? Warriors wear cloaks too. Agree?||Male Ranger Avatar: This is the male version of the cloaked elven warrior. He sports the same original armor set, except the colors have altered slightly. He's now wearing a skin-tight trousers in...||Ranger Fix: If you decided to use the Elven Ranger Avatars, I recommend you to use this as well. It's a fix for bow and spear so they would look natural on them.||Female Gladiator Avatar: For anyone who's interested, I am making a hot alternative to the human female fighter leather-armored avatar (HFB2).
ShineOnCaelar=This mod allows the player to overrule the coalition leaders and make an own decision about joining Caelar. Part 2 (WIP) will allow you to finally release the Shining Lady from Avernus and have her as ToB NPC.
sirene=Mod includes a soundset from Icewind Dale and a joinable lawful-good tiefling with a custom paladin kit, 1 new item and 3 new spells. She has interjections and banters with every Bioware and EE NPC at least once, talking more to good and neutral NPCs, and has 14 friendship talks. Currently there are no quests and no plans to add any. She can be found and recruited outside of the Song of the Morning Temple by a PC of non-evil alignment at level 2 with 2500 experience. In Siege of Dragonspear, she can be found in the Iron Throne building. She has a semi-romantic path with a PC with a minimum of 12 Charisma and any gender, alignment or race (though she will still not join evil protagonists).
SirinesCall=The Mod takes place in the coastal area south of Candlekeep, and involves the lighthouse, the treasure cavern, the sirines dwelling along the beach, and worgs and pirates.
soa=This mod involves a main quest and several subquests. There are new items and spells as well as lots of new creatures to fight.
song_and_silence=This mod enhances the thieves and bards, adds some new kits and items for both classes and some general fixes.
spell_rev=This mod improves the arcane and divine spells, removes different bugs, some weaker spells are improved and a few spells are completely remade.||Warning: This is a pre-release version that may not be stable. It is open for playtesting with the understanding that feedback is desired.
stratagems=This mod adds challenges, a better AI, NPC management and some more general changes. It features a substantially upgraded general AI (almost all monsters call for help intelligently, choose sensible targets, and use magic items) as well as much better AI for a lot of specific types of creatures (wizards, priests, sirines, basilisks...). It also upgrades enemy challenges in special fights.
subrace=A wizard waiting outside the Candlekeep Inn is eager to ask you some questions and thereby expose your ancestry by casting the Spell of Origins. Depending on you race you started the game with, you'll be able to advance to different ethnic groups of Faerun.||Warning! This mod needs to be downloaded manually. This mod is Expert because it prevents romances with NPCs.
TenyaThermidor=This is a mod that makes 12 year old Umberlant Tenya a joinable NPC, after you help her of course.
TGC1E=The mod adds a long quest to the game and several subquests as well, with many new characters, items, scripts and dialogs.
thalan=In this mod the magician Thalantyr known from the high hedge can improve objects magically and sell containers from BG2.
thepicturestandard=This mod provides you with higher resolution pics for NPCS including for some mods. These pics are true lore. I use the tactical BWS, therefore those pics have been updated too. This mod is or should be the picture standard for BG:EE and BG2:EE. If you find something better, then by all means: use that. But don't fall below this standard.
TomeAndBlood=Tome and Blood is a mod that revises and expands the class options for Mages and Sorcerers. This mod began as the Sorcerous Origins kitpack, which took advantage of the newly added Sorcerer kit options to add several kits to Sorcerers. It has since grown into a mod that makes changes to all Mage and Sorcerer kits, spells and items as well as adding dozens of new kits, abilities and functionality.
valerie=With tensions rising between Baldur's Gate and Amn, and rumors of unnatural disasters plaguing Amnish territory on the Sword Coast, a young Cowled Wizard has taken it upon herself to learn the truth of the matter. Adventurers willing to work with a Cowled Wizard will find a willing ally in their Nashkel investigations and beyond.| |This mod includes a friendship with flirtation opportunities, banters, interjections and comments on the world of Baldur's Gate.
verrsza=The mod introduces a new companion for BG1 - Verr'Sza, an evil rakshasa hunter. The mod includes crossmod talks with Sirene NPC. He may join your group in early BG1EE and stay with the group until the very end of Siege of Dragonspear expansion. He may be recruited in one of the rooms within the Friendly Arm Inn, but you must free him from a certain state first. He starts at 3rd level, so if you prefer having team members on more or less similar levels, it may be a good idea not to recruit him right after leaving Candlekeep.||The mod includes some go-and-kill quests, as well as a romance for both male and female characters (the only condition is not being of Lawful Good alignment). Although it's technically a romance, Verr'Sza isn't a very romantic character. It's more a matter of making him respect you and not trying to bind him in any way. He shouldn't be compared to Dorn, though. He may be protective in his twisted and blunt way.||Note that the mod may include language considered blunt or inappropriate for kids.
Vynd=Drow Assassin, recruitable at the Burning Wizard inn in Beregost. Though evil in alignment, he will not complain or leave due to reputation.
w_packmule=This mod adds a pack mule to the game. It will follow your party around and carry your equipment for you. You can buy the mule from a guy named Stedd, who can be found near the northeast exit of Waukeen's Promenade or in the courtyard of the Friendly Arm Inn.
WarslingSniperKit=The sling is a difficult weapon to master, but in the hands of a warsling sniper it becomes a precise tool of war. Experts of the weapon may come from any race.
wbgtap=Humorous small quests.
WeiDU=WeiDU is needed for the installation and the recent WeiDU.exe must always be placed in the directory where there is chitin.key file.
weidu-filechangelog=WeiDU-FileChangelog will shows which mod altered specified file
white=White-as-Bones is a chaotic neutral human male barbarian. Being a 2nd-Level character, he's available almost from the very beginning of the game.||The mod includes banters between White and all BioWare NPCs. All players may experience some friend talks. What's more, White may start to romance male characters of any race. If you're not interested, just tell him.
wmart=Deidre and Joluv, the bonus merchants from the second part of the series, make a stop in Baldur's Gate before they head to Amn. These merchants bring along their treasure trove of goods from the far off places they have visited. Their items are exotic, magical, expensive and likely overpowered.
WSR=This mod re-balances the Wizard Slayers and gives them new abilities.
XanBG1Friend=This mod provides a friendship path for Xan NPC in Baldur's Gate I.
xpmod=This Mod enables to reduce the points of experience for rewards because you get thousands of experience points for every "open locks" or "learning spells" agrees and you would have too fast too high values of experience.

The mod affects ALL mods installed before.
